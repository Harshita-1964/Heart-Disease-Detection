# Heart Disease Detection Using CNN-LSTM

This project focuses on detecting heart disease from phonocardiogram (PCG) signals using a hybrid Deep Learning architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 dataset and achieves high performance in classifying heart sound recordings into normal or abnormal classes.
